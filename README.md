  <strong>You think 4x faster than you type.</strong><br>
  Why are you still typing?
</p>

<br>

### The problem

Every day you type the same things: Slack replies, ChatGPT prompts, emails, code comments, Jira tickets, meeting notes. You know what you want to say — your fingers just can't keep up.

Voice-to-text apps exist, but they all suck. They open a separate window. They make you copy-paste. They don't work in your terminal. They cost $20/month.

### The solution

**Blablabla types where your cursor is.** No windows. No copy-paste. No subscriptions.

Hold a key. Speak. Release. Your words appear exactly where you were typing — Slack, VS Code, ChatGPT, Terminal, Notion, anywhere.

That's it. That's the app.

## Vibe coding at the speed of thought

You're building with Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, ChatGPT — and your bottleneck is **typing prompts**.

You know exactly what you want the AI to do. You can explain it in 5 seconds. But typing it out takes 30. So you write shorter prompts. Lazier prompts. Worse prompts.

**With Blablabla, you just talk.**

Hold a key → describe what you want → release → your prompt is in the text box. Hit Enter. Next prompt. Hold key. Talk. Release. Enter. Again. Again. Again.

You'll send more prompts in 10 minutes than you used to send in an hour. Your AI gets better instructions because you're not too lazy to explain context. You iterate faster. You vibe harder.

## How much does it cost?

**$0.**

Blablabla is free and open source. You bring your own AssemblyAI API key:

- **$50 free credit** on signup (that's ~135 hours of streaming)
- **10 hours/month free** after that
- Pay-as-you-go: $0.37/hour if you go over

For most people, the free tier is more than enough. You'd need to dictate **20 minutes every single day** to hit the limit.
